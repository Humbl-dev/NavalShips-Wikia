# NavalShips-Wikia
This is a basic Wikipedia project of Naval Ships in fleets from around the World. I hope to expand this with more pages and ship details in the coming moments.

If you would like to contribute, please email me, you will need to have an understanding of HTML/CSS and github commits/pulls, this is a static website. knowledge and reasearch in warships will also be required which can take an extensive amount of time.

For now, please leave any suggestions you may have!
